# Sublime Worksheet

This is a SublimeText 2 plugin which passes the contents of a buffer line-by-line to a REPL and displays the results inline.

It's inspired by the Scala worksheets in Eclipse, but designed to work for anything with a REPL (including Scala) without making you use Eclipse.

It's at a pretty early stage of development. There are working adapters for JavaScript (nodejs), Ruby (IRB) and Python defined in [worksheet.sublime-settings](worksheet.sublime-settings). There are still a few bugs and enhancements I need to sort out before adding it to Package Control.
