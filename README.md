# Sublime Worksheet

\* * * **PRE-ALPHA** * * *

This is a SublimeText 2 plugin which passes the contents of a buffer line-by-line to a REPL and displays the results inline.

It's inspired by the Scala worksheets in Eclipse, but designed to work for anything with a REPL (including Scala) without making you use Eclipse.

It's at a very early stage of development. There are barely working adapters for JavaScript (nodejs), Ruby (IRB) and Python defined in [worksheet.sublime-settings](worksheet.sublime-settings). There are lots of bugs, and it's pretty easy to hang or crash ST.
