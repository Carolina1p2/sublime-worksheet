# Sublime Worksheet

\* * * **PRE-ALPHA** * * *

This is a SublimeText 2 plugin which passes the contents of a buffer line-by-line to a REPL and displays the results inline.

It's inspired by the Scala worksheets in Eclipse, but designed to work for anything with a REPL (including Scala) without making you use Eclipse.

It's at a very early stage of development. Currently the only working REPL is nodejs, and it's pretty easy to hang or crash ST.
